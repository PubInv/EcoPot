# EcoPot
Project #5: A more efficient pot for those who cook over wood fires and related technologies


# Status as of June, 2025

Thanks to Cledden Kwanin and Ivan Urdiales, we have a computational fluid dynaimcs (CFD) simulation
based on OpenFOAM. We are approaching the ability to test hypotheses with this tool.

We have a particular design based on an initial hypothesis: The faster the flow around the pot,
the more the flames and hot flue gases will be "sucked" against the pot due to the CoandÄƒ effect/Bernoulli 
effect. Based on this idea, we have made a "fish" shaped pot (and lid) which is streamlined,
with heat transfer fins. 

Our initial goal is to compare this pot to a cylindrical pot.
